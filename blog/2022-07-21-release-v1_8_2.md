We are happy to announce the [V1.8.2 bugfix point release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.8.2) of [Black Magic Debug](https://black-magic.org).

## In this release

- Added “Fake thread support”. This is a work around, for a [bug in GDB V11 and V12](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/issues/929) where GDB crashes when the server that does not have threads. [dragonmux]

You can download pre-built firmware binaries from the GitHub release page. If you are downloading the sources archive, make sure to download the `full-sources` archives, otherwise you will not have the libopencm3 library that is necessary for firmware compilation. You can of course always check out the specific version tag using git.
