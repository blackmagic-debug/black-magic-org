# Black Magic Debug V1.9.0 Stable Release

```{post} January 27, 2023
:author: esden
```

We are happy to announce the [V1.9.0 stable release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.9.0) of [Black Magic Debug](https://black-magic.org). This ended up being much larger than intended, but exciting.

Here are some of the highlights:

- Improved SWD timings, addressing reliability issue with the previous release
- Extended support for RTT to all host platforms
- New `auto_scan` monitor command, allowing automatic scan chain detection
- New `erase_range` monitor command, allowing erasing Flash ranges on any target
- Added clang-tidy and clang-format configurations and project code formatting is enforced
- Introduced a [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) based Code of Conduct for contribution
- Introduced PR templates and contribution guidelines to streamline and simplify contribution and review processes
- Support for TCK/SWCLK High-Z when idle. This is needed for projects that reuse the TCK pin as GPIO during runtime. Especially useful for ultra low pin count devices.
- And a bunch of newly supported targets:
    - Atmel/Microchip SAMx7x
    - GigaDevice GD32F303
    - TI LM3S5732 and LM3S8962
    - ArteryTek ATF32F403A/407/415
    - CKS32F103
    - Renesas RA
