We are happy to announce the [V1.9.3 point release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.9.3) of [Black Magic Debug](https://black-magic.org).

## In this Release

- Fixed a bug in the firmware-side remote protocol initialisation logic that can in certain circumstances lead to the firmware crashing during remote protocol operations [dragonmux]
- Fixed a bug in BMDA’s `platform_buffer_write()` for Windows which would make it wrongly skip chunks of the buffer to write and corrupt the data to send [dragonmux]
- Fixed the initial USB CDC ACM notification packets being sent from the improper endpoints in the firmware [brainsmoke]
- Fixed a remote protocol UBSAN issue in BMDA [dragonmux]
- Fixed an issue for BMP (native) that in some cases would inhibit USB detach for DFU from being detected by the host [tlyu]
- Fixed a firmware bug in the SWD turnaround handling code that could trigger SWD no-response in reaction to requests on sensitive targets [tlyu]
