```

We are happy to announce the [V1.8.0 release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.8.0) of Black Magic Debug. It is a big one since we did not make a stable release since October 2020!!! So this release is very much overdue. But that also means we have a lot of new and interesting things in this release.

Here are some highlights:

- Added support for the new Black Magic Probe v2.3 hardware.
- Improved target scan reliability for devices that are asleep or using WFI.
- Black Magic App (BMA aka. hosted) now has better support of CMSIS-DAP probes.
- All python scripts and utilities were updated to run and require Python 3.
- Added GitHub Actions CI builds
- And a bunch of newly supported targets:
    - WCH CH32F103
    - GigaDevice GD32F1/F3
    - GigaDevice GD32E23x
    - NXP Kinetis K12 and placeholders for other K-Series MCUs
    - NXP LPC11xx XL, LPC546xx, LPC802, LPC804, LPC832 and LPC834
    - NXP MIMXRT10XX detection (no flash support)
    - NXP S32K14x, S32K118, S32K148
    - RaspberryPi RP2040
    - Microchip SAMD09
    - ST STM32G03/4/5/6/7/8/B/C, STM32G49x/G4Ax
    - ST STM32H7B3/B0/A3 & STM32H723/33/25/35/30
    - ST STM32L55
    - ST STM32WB55
    - ST STM32WLxx

You can download pre-built firmware binaries from the GitHub release page. If you are downloading the sources archive, make sure to download the `full-sources` archives, otherwise you will not have the libopencm3 library that is necessary for firmware compilation. You can of course always check out the specific version tag using git.

For more details please refer to the ChangeLog down below.

# Legend in Historical Context

Black Magic Debug consists of multiple elements that have fairly similar naming that can be confusing. To make this Change Log bit easier to decipher here is a little bit of history and term explanation.

Black Magic Debug (BMD) was originally designed as just a firmware for a purpose made hardware called Black Magic Probe (BMP) that can speak the GNU Debugger (GDB) “remote” serial protocol. The original BMP hardware is also called “native” as over time additional “Host” platforms were added that the firmware could be loaded onto. (such host hardware can be an STM32F4 discovery board, or ST-Link hardware and many more)

Additionally BMD can also be compiled as a stand alone PC application, (we call it Black Magic App, or **BMA** and formally known as **hosted**) that can act as a software in the middle, similar to the way OpenOCD works. In this case BMP is only acting as a USB to JTAG/SWD translator and the Black Magic App (BMA) does all the heavy lifting. Additionally this also allows the use of BMA with other probe hardware running non Black Magic Firmware (BMF), like for example: JLink, ST-Link, sw-link, FTDI and more.

- **Black Magic Debug** (abbreviated to **BMD**) - Is the project name, an umbrella describing the project but also sometimes acts as the term describing the software.
- **Black Magic Firmware** (abbrev. **BMF**) - More specifically just the Black Magic Firmware that is loaded either onto Black Magic Probe hardware or onto any other supported host hardware.
- **Black Magic Hosted** aka. **Black Magic App** (abbrev. **BMA**) - The Black Magic Debug system compiled as a PC application instead of a Firmware. Allowing it to be used in software in the middle mode instead of being contained to a hardware device. This is also sometimes just called “**hosted**” in the context of the project.
- **Black Magic Probe** (abbrev. **BMP**) - The “**native**” Black Magic Debug (BMD) hardware that was specifically designed and intended for the BMD project. This is the hardware you can buy from 1BitSquared, Adafruit and other resellers as “the Black Magic Probe”.
- **Black Magic Core** (Abbrev. BMC) - This describes the core code of the project that handles JTAG/SWD protocol, implements Flashing, target detection and all target specific functionality. It does not include host platform specific code like for example code that toggles GPIO.
- **Host Platform** - Refers to the hardware that the BMD software (either Firmware or Application) runs on. It can be the PC, STM32, lm4f or some more specific hardware like Black Magic Probe aka. native, ST-Link, sw-link and so on.
- **Probe** aka. **Cable** - Refers to the hardware that is connected between the PC running GDB (and/or BMA) and the Target (DUT). In the simplest case it is a USB to JTAG/SWD converter like an FTDI chip but in most cases it is a dedicated hardware running either our BMF or some other firmware.
- **Target** - Refers to the Device Under Test (DUT), this is the hardware that the user wants to debug using BMD.

- CMSIS-DAP: Fix CMSIS-DAP related memory leak [UweBonnes]
- Set reset type on every device [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Only CMSIS internal use must differentiate between HID and Bulk access [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Always work on a copy of the buffer when calling `dbg_dap_cmd()` in a loop [UweBonnes]
- Export BMP_TYPE in ARM Debug Port handler [UweBonnes]
- ST-Link: Fix low level access to Access Port registers [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Print messages when transfers fail [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Link against `libhidapi-hidraw` instead of `libhidapi-libusb`. The latter detaches the kernel module and does not reattach it again [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Always trasfer 65 bytes with `hid_read|write()` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Implement `srst_set_val()` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Access Port reads are posted. Read from `RDBUFF` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Removed `dp_low_read()` and use exception protected `dp_read()` instead [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Use exception in `wait_word()` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Run time detect `DAP_SWD_SEQUENCE` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Write only the necessary data in `dap_swdptap_seq_out` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Added timeout to bulk commands [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Added error returns when bulk transfers time out [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Allow transfer sizes to deal with words [UweBonnes]
- CLI: Assert if Flashing succeeded or failed once the last buffer has been written [fabalthazar]
- CLI: Allowing the use of monitor commands as preliminary actions [fabalthazar]
- CMSIS-DAP: Make the assert parameter to `dap_srst_set_val` a `bool` [koendv]
- USB: Additionally to Hub device class also exclude Wireless device class when scanning for Probes [UweBonnes]
- JTAG: Write `DO` generation code in an endian-independent way [UweBonnes]
- FTDI: Fix crash caused by the use of an out of date variable [UweBonnes]
- USB: Restrict the scope of the probe type variable [UweBonnes]
- FTDI: Fix bad length calculation in the MPSSE version of `swdptap_seq_in()` [UweBonnes]
- CMSIS-DAP: Corrected `tdi_tdi_seq` to take into account that not all platforms have division [dragonmux]
- bmp_libusb: Formatting cleanup [dragonmux]
- bmp_libusb: Fixed some signed/unsigned issues and UB in `send_recv` [dragonmux]
- bmp_libusb: Rewrote the string reader logic to not violate the USB spec and properly handle libusb errors [dragonmux]
- ST-Link V2: Rewrote the serial number reading logic to not violate the USB spec and properly handle libusb errors [dragonmux]
- ST-Link V2: Fix `!found` check causing hosted to continue on anyway, and improved the error reporting from the device finder loop [dragonmux]
- platform: Formatting consistency improvements [dragonmux]
- ST-Link V2: Cleaned up the new error messages as they weren't outputting nicely [dragonmux]
- CMSIS-DAP: Fixed some more communication issues [mubes] [dragonmux]
