## In this release

- Fixed an error in BMDA’s DAP link reset logic [zyp]
- Fixed the USB serial port control notifications (such as DTR) being sent over the wrong endpoint [dragonmux]
- Fixed the CRC32 calculations being broken in BMDA and non-STM32 probes [perigoso]
- Fixed a regression in the identification of STM32F0 parts [dragonmux]
- Fixed a regression in the `HOSTED_BMP_ONLY=1` build of BMDA for Windows due to mishandling a possible return value form `RegGetValue()` [LAK132]
- Fixed the nRF52 target support being able to trigger probe memory exhaustion due to the size of the write buffers [dragonmux]
- Fixed a `NULL` pointer dereference issue in the RTT monitor command when no arguments are given [koendv]
- Corrected the part lookup for STM32F4 series and adjacent parts [perigoso]
- Added a second set of symlinks to the udev rules to handle when multiple probes are attached to one host properly [dragonmux]
- Added a missing `NULL` check in `target_flash_erase` [perigoso]
- Fixed the BMDA build on OSX [djix123]
- Fixed the Cortex-M SWD attach regression that occurs when there is a delay between scan and attach [dragonmux]
- Fixed the target register description allocation inducing memory exhaustion and not being reliably cleaned up [dragonmux]
- Fixed compilation of the DFU bootloaders under some ARM GCC toolchains [dragonmux]
- Fixed a regression in BMDA’s file handling which caused Flash write and verify operations to be no-ops [hollinsky]
- Implemented a monitor command to allow clean BMDA shutdowns [dragonmux]
- Fixed dap_jtagtap_tdi_tdo_seq() crashing when ticks is 0 and final_tms is true [dragonmux]
