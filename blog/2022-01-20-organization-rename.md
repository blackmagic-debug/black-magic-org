# GitHub Organization Name Change

Hey everyone! As announced in the "New Maintainer" post we have now renamed the github organization from `blacksphere` to `blackmagic-debug`.

This reflects the fact that Black Magic Debug is no longer maintained by Gareth and Blacksphere was his consulting company.

You should not see much changing on your end as GitHub does redirect the old organization links to the new name automatically. This includes git links. But going forward you should use https://github.com/blackmagic-debug. We encourage you to update your local git clones too. You can update the links using the [`git remote set-url` command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote).

Let us know if you have any questions in the [#blackmagic Discord channel](https://1bitsquared.com/pages/chat).

Cheers,
Piotr Esden-Tempski
