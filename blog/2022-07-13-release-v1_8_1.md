We are happy to announce the [V1.8.1 bugfix point release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.8.1) of [Black Magic Debug](https://black-magic.org).

## In this release

- Fixed `HOSTED_BMP_ONLY` build of Black Magic Debug App (BMDA) [Qyriad]
- Fixed GDB protocol `sscanf` formatting pattern that was, among others, breaking breakpoints [dragonmux]
- Fixed a watchpoint handling issue and a register sanity check [aksdfauytv]
- Fixed CH32F probe routine so it does not overwrite the MCU ID code.
- Fixed an issue where Kinetis parts that write Flash 8 bytes at a time could get bricked. (affected parts: S32K and K64) [dragonmux]
- Fixed “reading old ADC values” issue on Black Magic Probe (BMP aka. native) V2.3 hardware. [esden]
- Fixed flash memory write buffer lifetimes to decrease the probability of running out of heap. [dragonmux]
- Fixed an issue where mass_erase command on STM32F4 was returning a `Failed` result in most cases. [esden]

You can download pre-built firmware binaries from the GitHub release page. If you are downloading the sources archive, make sure to download the `full-sources` archives, otherwise you will not have the libopencm3 library that is necessary for firmware compilation. You can of course always check out the specific version tag using git.
