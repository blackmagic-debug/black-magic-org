We are happy to announce the [V1.8.1 bugfix point release](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases/tag/v1.8.1) of [Black Magic Debug](https://black-magic.org).

## In this release

- Fixed `HOSTED_BMP_ONLY` build of Black Magic Debug App (BMDA) [Qyriad]
- Fixed GDB protocol `sscanf` formatting pattern that was, among others, breaking breakpoints [dragonmux]
- Fixed a watchpoint handling issue and a register sanity check [aksdfauytv]
- Fixed CH32F probe routine so it does not overwrite the MCU ID code.
- Fixed an issue where Kinetis parts that write Flash 8 bytes at a time could get bricked. (affected parts: S32K and K64) [dragonmux]
- Fixed “reading old ADC values” issue on Black Magic Probe (BMP aka. native) V2.3 hardware. [esden]
- Fixed flash memory write buffer lifetimes to decrease the probability of running out of heap. [dragonmux]
- Fixed an issue where mass_erase command on STM32F4 was returning a `Failed` result in most cases. [esden]

You can download pre-built firmware binaries from the GitHub release page, or clone the repository and check out the v1.8.1 tag for the source code. (GitHub does not include submodules in the source code tarballs, thus you will not be able to use that tarball to build the binaries.)
